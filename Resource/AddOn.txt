			'Description: 
			'The function block use a Ethernet/IP connection to communicate with a SICK device.
			'The FB makes it possible to send and receive sensor data. The Confirmed
			'Messaging protocol (CM) is used to receive even long, fragmented read results.
			'
			'Send a command:
			'The bReq parameter must be triggered with a rising edge (signal change FALSE to 
			'TRUE) in order to carry out the function. For the time during which a valid response 
			'has yet to be received from the device, the bReqBusy parameter is used to signal 
			'that a response is still pending.The module signals the bReqDone = TRUE output 
			'parameter when the function has been successfully completed. If data was requested 
			'by the device, this data is copied into the Record. The bReqDone indicates that new 
			'data has been received  for a PLC cycle. Only one CoLa command request can be 
			'send to the same device at one time. 
			'
			'Receive a reading result:
			'Data sent via trigger command or directly by the device (e.g., direct trigger via a light 
			'barrier) is stored in the Record. The bReadDone output indicates that new data has
			'been received for a PLC cycle. The iReadCount counter also increases by one. 
			'The data sent by the device can be changed or adapted in SOPAS output format. 
			'
			'This AOI supports the folowing SICK devices:
			'- LECTOR62x
			'- RFU63x
			'- CLV6xx (Read only, sending of a telgram is not supported)
			'- RFH62x (Read only, sending of a telgram is not supported)
